Installation notes:

QUICK AND EASY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Just run the gpgdir installation script "install.pl" from the gpgdir
sources directory:


# ./install.pl

Note that you need to be root since gpgdir will need to install the
GnuPG::Interface, Class::MethodMaker, and Term::ReadKey perl modules in
/usr/lib/gpgdir.  Gpgdir makes use of perl modules from this directory
so as to not pollute perl modules that are installed in the system perl
lib tree.
