Installation notes:

QUICK AND EASY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Just run the gpgdir installation script "install.pl" from the gpgdir
sources directory:


# ./install.pl

Note that you need to be root since gpgdir will need to install the
GnuPG::Interface, Class::MethodMaker, and Term::ReadKey perl modules in
/usr/lib/gpgdir.  Gpgdir makes use of perl modules from this directory
so as to not pollute perl modules that are installed in the system perl
lib tree.  Note that if any of the modules that are already needed by
gpgdir are already installed in the system perl library tree, then gpgdir
will preferentially use them instead of installing them within the
/usr/lib/gpgdir/ directory.
