.SH NAME
.B gpgdir
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpgdir [-e
.I directory
.B ] [-d
.I directory
.B ] [-n] [-c] [-u] [-p
.I pw-file
.B ] [-v] [-h]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gpgdir
is a perl script that uses the CPAN GnuPG perl module to encrypt and decrypt
directories using a gpg key specified in ~/.gpgdirrc.
.B gpgdir
recursively descends through a directory in order to make sure it encrypts or
decrypts every file in a directory and all of its subdirectories.  In order
to help save space all files can optionally be compressed using gzip before
being encrypted and uncompressed upon decryption through the use of the
.B -c
and
.B -u
options.
Note that
.B gpgdir
is careful not encrypt hidden files and directories.  After all, you probably
don't want your ~/.gnupg directory or ~/.bashrc file to be encrypted.
