.SH NAME
.B gpgdir
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpgdir [-e <directory>] [-d <directory>] --no-recurse --no-compress
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gpgdir
is a perl script that uses the CPAN GnuPG perl module to encrypt and decrypt
directories using a gpg key specified in ~/.gpgdirrc.  gpgdir recursively
descends through a directory in order to make sure it encrypts or decrypts
every file in a directory and all of its subdirectories.  In order to help
save space all files are compressed using gzip before being encrypted and
uncompressed upon decryption.  In addition, gpgdir is careful not encrypt
hidden files and directories.  gpgdir will compress each file using gzip
unless the --no-compress option is specified.
