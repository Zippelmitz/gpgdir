gpgdir is a perl script that uses the CPAN GnuPG perl module to encrypt and
decrypt directories using a gpg key specified in ~/.gpgdirrc.  gpgdir
recursively descends through a directory in order to make sure it encrypts or
decrypts every file in a directory and all of its subdirectories.  In order
to help save space all files can optionally be compressed using gzip before
being encrypted and uncompressed upon decryption through the use of the -c
and -u options.  Note that gpgdir is careful not encrypt hidden files and
directories.  After all, you probably don't want your ~/.gnupg directory or
~/.bashrc file to be encrypted.


Installation:
    Just run the install.pl script (as root) that comes with the gpgdir
    sources.


Command line options:
   -e, --encrypt <directory>  - Encrypt <directory> and all of its
                                subdirectories.
   -d, --decrypt <directory>  - Decrypt <directory> and all of its
                                subdirectories.
   -c, --compress             - Compress files when running in --encrypt mode.
   -u, --uncompress           - Uncompress files when running in --decrypt mode.
   -n, --no-recurse           - Don't recursively encrypt/decrypt subdirectories.
   -p, --pw-file <file>       - Read password in from <file>.
   -v, --version              - print version.
   -h, --help                 - print help.


Examples:
    Encrypt a directory called "testdir" in your home directory:
    $ gpgdir -e ~/testdir

    Decrypt ~/testdir:
    $ gpgdir -d ~/testdir

    Encrypt only ~/testdir and no subdirectories:
    $ gpgdir -e ~/testdir --no-recurse
