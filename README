gpgdir is a perl script that uses the CPAN GnuPG module to encrypt and decrypt
directories using a gpg key specified in ~/.gpgdirrc.  gpgdir supports
recursively descending through a directory in order to make sure it encrypts
or decrypts every file in a directory and all of its subdirectories.  In order
to help save space all files are compressed using gzip before being encrypted
and decompressed upon decryption.  In addition, gpgdir is careful not encrypt
hidden files and directories.  After all you probably don't want your ~/.gnupg
directory or ~/.bashrc file to be encrypted. :)

Installation:
    Just root the install.pl script (as root) that comes with the gpgdir
    sources.

Command line options:
    -e  --encrypt  <directory>    Encrypt <directory>
    -d  --decrypt  <directory     Decrypt <directory>
    --no-recurse                  Don't recurse through subdirectories
    --no-compress                 Don't compress files


Examples:
    Encrypt a directory called "testdir" in your home directory:
    $ gpgdir -e ~/testdir

    Decrypt ~/testdir:
    $ gpgdir -d ~/testdir

    Encrypt only ~/testdir and no subdirectories:
    $ gpgdir -e ~/testdir --no-recurse
