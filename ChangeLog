gpgdir-1.8 (03//2008):
    - Updated the test suite to validate the gpgdir --Obfuscate-filenames
      mode to ensure that files are encrypted as "gpgdir_<pid>_<num>.gpg".
    - Minor bug fix to remove the .gpgdir_map_file in --Obfuscate-filenames
      mode after a successful decryption cycle.

gpgdir-1.7 (02/18/2008):
    - Bugfix to ensure that encrypted directories can actually be decrypted.
      This bug was reported by Per Ronny Westin.
    - Updated to use the ".asc" extension for encrypted files in --Plain-ascii
      mode.
    - Added gpgdir test suite.  All future gpgdir releases (and including this
      1.7 release) require that all gpgdir tests pass on the systems where
      gpgdir is developed.

gpgdir-1.6 (02/17/2008):
    - Bugfix to not include previously encrypted files (i.e. those with a .gpg
      extension) in the encryption/decryption file list.  This bug was
      introduced in gpgdir-1.5 when a change was made to ignore ascii-armored
      files.
    - Added added LC_ALL=C locale setting for the install.pl script (this
      should help to ensure gpgdir is properly installed on most systems). Two
      new command line arguments --LC_ALL and --no-LC_ALL also allow the
      locale setting to be changed or not used at all.
    - Added --Exclude-mod-regex option to the install.pl script so that it is
      possible to force the exclusion of perl modules that gpgdir would
      normally install. This is useful for ensuring that gpgdir references
      perl modules that are already installed in the system perl library tree
      instead of using those that are installed in /usr/lib/gpgdir.
    - Updated to display command line usage warnings without automatically
      displaying the entire usage() page (which is quite long).

gpgdir-1.5 (08/31/2007):
    - Added the --Symmetric option so that files can be encrypted/decrypted
      via a symmetric encryption algorithm (GnuPG commonly uses CAST5 for
      this).
    - Added the --Plain-ascii option so that GnuPG is invoked with the -a
      option so that encrypted files are ascii armored instead of encrypted in
      binary form.
    - Bugfix to ensure not to delete zero-size files if a bad password is
      given (gpgdir now just throws a warning and exits in this case).
    - Minor code enhancements to provide a consistent hash_init() invocation
      with the same options hash.
    - Updated to exclude .asc files from the encryption/decryption process.

gpgdir-1.4 (07/20/2007):
    - (Anthony Chivetta) Submitted patch to implement the
      --overwrite-encrypted command line argument to allow previously
      encrypted files to be overwritten. This is useful for updating an
      encrypted directory with new versions of the previously encrypted files.
      Also added the --overwrite-decrypted command line argument to perform
      the same function for previously decrypted files.
    - (Anthony Chivetta) Submitted patch to fix a bug where a filename of
      "0.gpg" could not be decrypted because "0" does not evaluate to a true
      value.

gpgdir-1.3 (06/09/2007):
    - Added --Obfuscate mode so that the files within a directory can be
      altered into unrecognizable names (which are stored within the file
      .gpgdir_map_file within each sub-directory, and this file is itself
      encrypted).  The obfuscated file names are reversed when a directory
      is decrypted.
    - Added the --Agent-info command line argument so that the value of the
      GPG_AGENT_INFO environment variable can be specified on the gpgdir
      command line.

gpgdir-1.2 (05/28/2007):
    - Added support for installing gpgdir on Windows under Cygwin (via the
      install.pl script). Installing gpgdir on FreeBSD systems also works.
    - Added support for installing gpgdir within a user home directory without
      the need for root access (this requires installing gpgdir with the
      install.pl script).
    - Added --agent to have gpgdir acquire gpg key password from a running
      gpg-agent instance.
    - Added --no-password so gpgdir can use a gpg key with no associated
      password (this is not common).  The user is not prompted for a password
      in this case.

gpgdir-1.1 (05/21/2007):
    - Added the ability to securely delete the original versions of files with
      the 'wipe' program (after they have been successfully encrypted).  Also
      added --wipe-path to specify a path to the wipe binary (the default is
      /usr/bin/wipe), --wipe-interactive to force the wipe program to prompt
      the user before a file is deleted, and --wipe-cmdline to allow the user
      to build a set of command line arguments that are passed to the wipe
      program.
    - Added --Force to have gpgdir skip over the error condition where a file
      cannot be deleted (because of a permissions issue for example).
    - Added --Trial-run to allow the user to see what actions gpgdir would
      take to encrypt or decrypt files, but no files are actually modified.
    - Added --Interactive to have gpgdir prompt the user before every file is
      encrypted, decrypted.
    - Added the gpgdir.SlackBuild script (contributed by pyllyukko originally
      for the psad project) for building gpgdir on Slackware systems.

gpgdir-1.0.3 (09/17/2006):
    - Minor bugfix to correct 1.0.1 version number (which should have been set
      to 1.0.2) in the gpgdir RPM spec file.

gpgdir-1.0.2 (09/17/2006):
    - Minor bugfix to correct 1.0 version number (which should have been set
      to 1.0.1).  The result is the 1.0.2 release.

gpgdir-1.0.1 (09/16/2006):
    - Added --quiet option to have gpgdir print as little as possible to the
      screen when encrypting or decrypting a directory.
    - Added x86_64 RPM (original patch from Mate Wierdl adapted for gpgdir).

gpgdir-1.0 (09/13/2006):
    - Added --Key-id command line argument so that use_key can be overridden
      from the command line
    - Made the argument to use_key not have to strictly be a keyID since GnuPG
      allows a unique string match on keys in the key ring
    - Added --Default-key to allow the user to have gpgdir use the default
      key that is defined by GnuPG within the ~/.gnupg/options file.
    - Updated the .gpgdirrc file to include the line "default_key" to allow
      the user to have gpgdir prefer to use the GnuPG default key.
    - Added the ChangeLog.svn file to show exactly which files have been
      changed from release to release, and what the corresponding Subversion
      log messages are.
    - Minor documentation updates.

gpgdir-0.9.9 (09/07/2006):
    - Added RPM .spec file to build gpgdir as an RPM.
    - Added the --Skip-mod-install command line argument to install.pl to
      allow all perl module installs to be skipped.
    - Added the --force-mod-regex command line argument to install.pl to allow
      a regex match on perl module names to force matching modules to be
      installed.
    - Updated to TermReadKey-2.30 from 2.21.

gpgdir-0.9.8 (07/03/2006):
    - Updated to use GnuPG::Interface instead of GnuPG module.  This should
      fix the incompatibility issues seen between the GnuPG module and some
      GnuPG installations.
    - Added perl module installation code from fwknop (see
      http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/).  This allows gpgdir to
      preferentially use any perl modules that are already be installed on the
      system.

gpgdir-0.9.4 (10/12/2005):
    - Updated test mode to encrypt and decrypt a testing file within the
      directory to be encrypted or decrypted.  This file is located at
      <dir>/gpgdir_test, and is removed after the test is completed.
    - Bugfix for "protocol error: expected SHM_GET_XXX got GOOD_PASSPHRASE"
      error in GnuPG module.

gpgdir-0.9.3 (02/20/2005):
    - Added --Include and --Include-from options to allow inclusion
      regular expressions to be specified.
    - Bugfix for not decrypting filesnames that contain spaces.

gpgdir-0.9.2 (01/05/2005):
    - Added preservation of file mtime and atime values (may be disabled
      with the --no-preserve-times option).
    - Added testing encryption and decryption of dummy file (may be
      disabled with --skip-test) by default for both encrypt and decrypt
      modes.
    - Added --test-mode to run encrypt -> decrypt test and exit.
    - Removed unnecessary compression options.
    - Updated get_homedir() to reference HOME environmental variable if
      the /etc/passwd file does not exist (OS X being a good example).
    - Added --verbose mode.
    - Updated output to generate errors on a per-file basis instead of
      dumping them at the end of an encrypt/decrypt operation.

gpgdir-0.9.1 (11/11/2004):
    - Updated GnuPG.pm perl module to handle return code of PLAINTEXT
      which seems to be returned by GunPG now (as of version 1.2.6)
      instead of DECRYPTION_OKAY upon a successful decryption.

gpgdir-0.9 (09/12/2004):
    - Added --gnupg-dir option to allow a user to specify a different
      user's .gnupg directory for encryption keys.
    - Switched to "[+]" (and related) message prefixes.

gpgdir-0.8 (05/29/2004):
    - Added --Exclude and --Exclude-from options to allow files to be
      excluded based on regex matches.
    - Reworked error messages so they contain the filename associated
      with each error.

gpgdir-0.4 (04/23/2004):
    - Added --pw-file option so that a decryption password can be
      read out of a file.
    - Better directory validation (filesystem -e and -d checks).
    - Added INSTALL file.
    - Updated man page and README file.

gpgdir-0.3 (09/27/2003):
    - Bundled perl modules GnuPG and TermReadKey with gpgdir.
    - Modified install.pl and gpgdir to install and use GnuPG and
      TermReadKey modules from the /usr/lib/gpgdir directory.
    - Added check_commands() subroutine from psad.
